# Video Classification using VGG16 and LSTM

This project implements a video classification model that combines the power of VGG16 for feature extraction with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for temporal sequence learning. It was developed as a learning exercise to understand LSTM networks and their applications in video processing.

## üìö About LSTM Networks

Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks are a special kind of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) that excel at learning from sequential data. Unlike traditional neural networks, LSTMs have a "memory cell" that can maintain information for long periods. They solve the vanishing gradient problem that standard RNNs face through a series of gates:

- **Forget Gate**: Decides what information to discard from the cell state
- **Input Gate**: Decides which new information to store in the cell state
- **Output Gate**: Decides what parts of the cell state to output

This architecture makes LSTMs particularly effective for tasks involving time series data, such as video classification.

## üèóÔ∏è Project Architecture

The model architecture consists of two main components:

1. **VGG16 Feature Extraction**:
   - Utilizes the pre-trained VGG16 model to extract rich features from video frames
   - Processes individual snapshots extracted from the video dataset

2. **LSTM Sequential Learning**:
   - Takes the features extracted by VGG16 as input
   - Learns temporal patterns and relationships between consecutive frames
   - Makes final classification decisions based on the temporal sequence
